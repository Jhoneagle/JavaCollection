## About

This is mainly just for practising generic classes, interfaces and abstractions but also in some way meant to become library somepoint possibly. Mainly contributing in free time and using it as collection of self created java code of whatever feel like makeing. 

Mainly trying to keep everything that can be tested tested as well as possible. But atleast in begging this wont happen most likely.
